# linkedList

The C program uses a linked list to hold and print a list of words of up to 30 characters, one per line. 
When new word is inserted it follows a comma and the position in the list where the word should be 
inserted(for e.g : word , 2). When the user enters '$' on a line by itself,the program will stop taking 
new words.
